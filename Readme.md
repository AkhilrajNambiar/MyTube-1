# MyTube - A YouTube clone

MyTube is an app that was created to improve my overall skills in Android, and to showcase my immense love for an app like YouTube.

There is no sign-in with google involved in this app, so definitely do check this out for free, without any fear of privacy issues.

But for all those who don't have Android Studio on their PCs, I am attaching a video link to the overall working of the app.

The following video just shows the comments and replies section that was implemented for a video.
